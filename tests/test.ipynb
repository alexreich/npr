The tax bill accomplishes part of that goal by eliminating the penalty for  individuals who don't get health insurance. \",\n",

After the House passed what was believed to be the final version of the bill on Tuesday, Democratic senators challenged provisions relating to education and a technical issue over the naming of the bill.

      "        \"\\\"We knew African-American women were more likely to be poor,\\\" says David. \\\"We knew that fewer of them had completed their education by the time they were bearing children.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"But David, who at the time was at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, and his colleague <a href=\\\"http://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=10858\\\">James Collins</a> at Northwestern University Medical School found that <a href=\\\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.80.6.679\\\">even educated, middle-class African-American</a> women were at a higher risk of having smaller, premature babies with a lower chance of survival.\",\n",
      "        \"For example, David says, black and white teenage mothers growing up in poor neighborhoods both have a higher risk of having smaller, premature babies. \\\"They both have something like a 13 percent chance of having a low birth weight baby,\\\" he says.\",\n",
      "        \"But in higher-income neighborhoods where women are likely to be slightly older and more educated, \\\"among white women, the risk of low birth weight drops dramatically to about half of that, whereas for African-American women, it only drops a little bit.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"In fact, today, a college-educated black woman like Samantha Pierce is more likely to give birth prematurely than a white woman with a high school degree.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"That's exactly the kind of case that makes us ask the question: What else is there?\\\" says David. \\\"What are we missing?\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"Some people suggested that the root cause may be genetics. But if genes are at play, then women from Africa would also have the same risks. So, David and his colleague, Collins, looked at the babies of immigrant women from West Africa. But as they reported in their <a href=\\\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199710233371706#t=article\\\">1997 study</a> in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine, </em>those babies were more like white babies \\u2014 they were bigger and more likely to be full term. So, <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1913086/\\\">it clearly isn't genetics</a>, says David.\",\n",
      "        \"Then, many years later, David and Collins noticed something startling. The grandchildren of African immigrant women were born smaller than their mothers had been at birth. In other words, the grandchildren were more likely to be premature, like African-American babies.\",\n",
      "        \"This was also true of the grandchildren of black women who had emigrated from the Caribbean.\",\n",
      "        \"Meanwhile, the grandchildren of white European immigrant women were bigger than their mothers when they were born. David and Collins <a href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/155/3/210/63367\\\">published their results</a> in 2002 in the <em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em>.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"So, there was something about growing up black in the United States and then bearing a child that was associated with lower birth weight,\\\" says David.\",\n",
      "        \"<strong>Growing up black and female in America</strong>\",\n",
      "        \"What is different about growing up black in America is discrimination, says David. \\\"It's hard to find any aspect of life that's not impacted by racial <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1842536\\\">discrimination</a>,\\\" he says. \\\"Whether you're talking about applying for a job, or purchasing a new car, finding housing, getting education ... even given equal education, earning the same amount of money, that doesn't happen. If you're black, you tend to get less pay.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"As a recent poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H.

      "        \"In 2004, David and Collins published <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448603/\\\">a study</a> in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em> in which they reported the connection between a mother's experience of racism and preterm birth. They asked women about their housing, income, health habits and discrimination. \\\"It turned out that as a predictor of a very low birth weight outcome, these racial discrimination questions were more powerful than asking a woman whether or not she smoked cigarettes,\\\" David says.\",\n",
      "        \"<a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448602/\\\">Other studies</a> have shown the same results.\",\n",
      "        \"Samantha Pierce didn't know this when she was pregnant back in 2009. But she did know discrimination. She was 7 or 8 years old the first time someone called her the N-word. She was with her mother, visiting Murray Hill, Cleveland's Italian neighborhood.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"We were just driving through,\\\" she says. \\\"We were driving, literally with our windows down, and we were called niggers, just going up the hill.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"The memory still makes her angry. \\\"It does not matter that my mother owned her own home,\\\" says Pierce. \\\"It does not matter that we owned that car, because we did! It did not matter that I went to private school, because I did!<strong> </strong>When I was riding up Murray Hill, I was a nigger, and so was my mother.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"It wasn't the only time she was made to feel inferior for being black. She felt it at school, too.\",\n",
      "        \"Pierce remembers her mother warning her early on in her childhood that she would have to \\\"work twice as hard to get half as much\\\" as her white counterparts, she says.\",\n",
      "        \"She says her mother's words ring true even today at work.\",\n",
      "        \"Then there is the everyday racism, says Pierce, like being shadowed at stores by the staff, even when she is with a white friend. Pierce says her white friends don't even notice. These kinds of things happen every day, she says.\",\n",
      "        \"Black women are often the primary breadwinner and caregiver, Arthur James from Ohio State notes. That is partly because of the higher incarceration rate and unemployment rate among black men, he says. \\\"That's added to the burden of black women.\\\" That burden and the stress from discrimination, it all adds up, he says.\",\n",
      "        \"<strong>Stress and labor</strong>\",\n",
      "        \"When we are stressed, our bodies produce stress hormones. When the source of stress goes away, so do the stress hormones. It's a normal, healthy process. But when someone is stressed out all the time, their bodies have perpetually high levels of stress hormones.\",\n",
      "        \"Stress hormones are also naturally high during normal, full-term labor. But if a woman goes into a pregnancy with already high levels of stress hormones, she is more likely to deliver prematurely, says James.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"We think that higher levels of stress hormones increase the incidence of pre-term labor,\\\" he says.\",\n",
      "        \"When Samantha Pierce first learned about this, a few years after her twins died, it was as if a light bulb went off. \\\"Stress leads to labor. And African-American women live a more stressful life,\\\" she says. \\\"And so we hit preterm birth at an alarming rate.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"Pierce went on to get pregnant again. This time, too, she had twins. She was placed on bed rest, but the pregnancy went smoothly. Her twins \\u2014 a boy and a girl \\u2014 are now 7 years old and healthy.\",\n",
      "        \"These days, Pierce is on a mission to fight back against all the stress for her generation of black women and also her daughter's. And she uses exercise as a weapon. She works out regularly at a gym in Cleveland with other women. And she is now a certified personal trainer. Her clients are mostly African-American women.\",\n",
      "        \"Exercise isn't just about getting fit, she says. It can also provide social support, which many black women say they lack.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"We really are hard on ourselves,\\\" says Pierce. \\\"And so we really need other women, especially other black women to say, 'I see you. You're doing fine. Keep going.' \\\"\",\n",
      "        \"Pierce can't change how society treats black women. But she is trying hard to change how black women cope with stress. If they can make their bodies more resilient, it might give their babies a better chance of surviving.\"\n",

But in Vieques, a remote island with nearly 9,000 residents eight miles off the main island's coast, recovery is a long way off. There, some live in dingy conditions as they wait for help to rebuild, while others gather what they can to do it themselves.\",\n",

The roof and several walls are caved in; the interior is a moldy mess of tree branches and destroyed furniture. One of the only things left standing is the bright pink facade adorned with a painted white horse.\",\n",

They're now squatting in a home across the street, which they say has been abandoned for decades with unknown owners. \\\"They left and never came back,\\\" he says. \\\"We invaded it in order to save our lives, because if not we would have died.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"This abandoned house has no electricity or running water. His niece demonstrates how they draw brown, foul-smelling water for bathing from an improvised well in the back of the home. There's almost no furniture \\u2013 a few chairs and a mattress placed on the floor in the middle of the room. A shelving unit has some packets of tuna, hand sanitizer and paper towels. Volunteers from a local aid organization try to keep the family supplied with bottles of drinking water and other necessities.\",\n",
      "        \"Asked if he feels that the U.S. government is neglecting Vieques residents, who are citizens, Rivera says \\\"all the time. ... FEMA is supposed to help the people. And they have not even inspected, they have done nothing.\\\"\",\n",

      "        \"\\\"It was very frustrating, seeing one's home destroyed to the ground, something that was made with so much effort, the only thing one has in one's life,\\\" says Melendez. Hurricane Irma took the roof off, and then Maria destroyed the rest of their home.\",\n",
      "        \"He and his wife, Felicita Garcia, scavenged pieces of wood from hurricane debris to construct a new structure \\u2013 one part of the wall red, one blue, one raw wood.\",\n",

One corner of the house<strong> </strong>is still exposed to the elements. \\\"As you can see he's been doing this on a piecemeal basis, in order to finish this house it will take a long time,\\\" says Garcia. \\\"Years,\\\" her husband sighs.\",\n",
      "        \"There's not a lot of wood to be found because many others here are trying to rebuild their homes, too. Destroyed structures dot the lush hillsides around them, where trees have already grown back their leaves in the months since the hurricane ripped them away.\",\n",
      "        \"To their great delight, electricity from the island's generator started working the previous week. They demonstrated how a bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on. Power isn't reaching all the island's homes, and goes in and out.\",\n",
      "        \"The couple's rebuilding efforts are rooted in a belief that no one is coming to help them. \\\"This here is no man's land,\\\" says Garcia. \\\"No man's land because no one sees us. ... I'm 66 years old and all my life Vieques has been marginalized. No one has done anything for Vieques, never.\\\"\",\n",

      "        \"She's wearing a t-shirt with a heart, patterned with the U.S. flag. \\\"I do not have hard feelings against the United States,\\\" Garcia says. \\\"Our sentiment is, why have we been marginalized so?\\\"\"\n",

      "        \"Cardinal Bernard Law, the former archbishop of Boston \\u2014 once widely seen as America's most influential prelate before resigning in disgrace amid the growing clergy sexual abuse scandal \\u2014 has died in Rome.\",\n",
      "        \"The Holy See's press office confirmed Law's death \\\"after a long illness.\\\" He was 86.\",\n",
      "        \"In a carefully worded statement, reflecting the ongoing anger at the longtime prelate for his role helping to cover up the sins of pedophile priests, his successor, Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley said, \\\"I recognize that Cardinal Law's passing brings forth a wide range of emotions ...particularly ... all who experienced the trauma of sexual abuse by clergy.\\\" He offered \\\"sincere apologies [and] continued prayers and ... support.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"O'Malley went on to say, \\\"It is a sad reality that for many, Cardinal Law's life and ministry is identified with one overwhelming reality, the crisis of sexual abuse by priests ... because his pastoral legacy has many other dimensions,\\\" from civil rights and ecumenical work, to his care for the poor and immigrants.\",\n",
      "        \"The Vatican on Wednesday also released a statement expressing condolences, praying \\\"for the repose of his soul,\\\" but making no mention of the clergy's sexual abuse scandal.\",\n",
      "        \"Law was at ground zero of the crisis when it exploded in Boston in 2002. He remained the face of the scandal, as it swelled to the tsunami that engulfed the Catholic Church worldwide.\",\n",
      "        \"Law's response to the growing crisis only fueled the rage. For example, shortly after the scandal broke, he showed little compunction, issuing a carefully worded, Nixonian concession.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"Judgments were made ... which in retrospect were tragically incorrect,\\\" he said. Even as allegations and protests continued to mount, parishioners seethed that Law \\\"still didn't get it.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"These are not easy days to serve in the pastoral role that is mine,\\\" he allowed at a special Mass in Boston in April 2002.\",\n",
      "        \"It was only after almost a year, when even his own priests were publicly calling on him to quit, that <a href=\\\"http://www.wbur.org/news/2015/09/22/cardinal-bernard-law\\\">Law did so </a>after 19 years as head of the Boston Archdiocese. Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes, I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness,\\\" he said in a statement announcing his resignation. \\\"The particular circumstances of this time suggest a quiet departure. Please keep me in your prayers.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"It was a shattering fall from grace.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"This was a man who came to Boston with great promise and hope, and people were talking about him being the first American pope,\\\" recalled attorney Eric MacLeish, who represented hundreds of clergy abuse victims and made the once-venerated and powerful cardinal squirm through days of depositions.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"He ended up in disgrace,\\\" MacLeish said.\",\n",
      "        \"Law also left behind parishioners in a crisis of faith, and a church in financial crisis. The archdiocese would ultimately sell some of its most valuable real estate, including the cardinal's residence, to pay about $85 million in settlements to more than 500 victims.\",\n",
      "        \"In 2003, Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly issued a scathing report saying \\\"the mistreatment of children was so massive and so prolonged that it borders on the unbelievable.\\\" The report estimated that nearly 800 children had been abused by at least 237 priests over a period of six decades.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"Time after time ... when [senior clergy] were tested ... and faced with the choice between protecting children or protecting the reputation of the church and the priest abusers, they chose secrecy,\\\" Reilly said. \\\"In effect, they sacrificed children for many, many years.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"While Reilly said the archbishop could not be prosecuted under the weak laws in place at the time, the attorney general said Law \\\"bears the ultimate responsibility\\\" for what happened. Reilly added that Law did not \\\"bear sole responsibility.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"Indeed, it would come out later that countless others in the church transgressed as well. But James Post, who founded the lay activist group Voice of the Faithful in response to the scandal, said Law will be remembered for the sins of them all.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"He was the poster child for a church that was in denial and refused to acknowledge the facts of this terrible abuse,\\\" said Post.\",\n",
      "        \"The scandal eclipses Law's long career as a minister and self-described \\\"meddler\\\" in politics. He was as well-connected in Washington, D.C., as he was in Rome and outspoken on everything from abortion and affordable housing to foreign policy.\",\n",
      "        \"He was a staunch advocate for immigrants and the poor and having started his career in Mississippi in the 1960s, he was a champion for civil rights and better race relations. Law was also known for his ecumenical work, building bridges to the Protestant and Jewish communities.\",\n",
      "        \"But David G. Clohessy, who was national director of the victims' advocacy group, Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said Law's legacy will forever be stained by his failure to protect his flock.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"Bishops' No. 1 goal is to follow the example of Jesus Christ, safeguarding the most vulnerable,\\\" he said, fighting back tears more than a decade after the scandal broke.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"I get choked up about this because imagine how this would be different had Cardinal Law said [to church officials] 'You've got to report anything you know or suspect,'\\\"  Clohessy said.\",\n",
      "        \"Born in Mexico, to an Air Force pilot and a mother who converted to Catholicism, Law was known as a stalwart of Catholic orthodoxy. His desire to guard against dissent led him to be influential in <a href=\\\"http://www.ncregister.com/blog/mbunson/the-catechism-turns-25\\\">the creation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.</a>\",\n",
      "        \"While he struck many as autocratic and arrogant, Law saw himself as a loyal servant, defending the church and its top-down hierarchy, according to James Bretzke, Boston College professor of moral theology.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"He considered himself to be a prince of the church and responsible for upholding the dignity of the church and protecting it as an institution,\\\" said Bretzke. \\\"I think that was part of his overall corporate mentality.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"With time, some people are hoping the cardinal will come to be seen in a more sympathetic light, as a product of a different era.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"I personally don't believe he could possibly have been indifferent to the children,\\\" said the Rev. Joseph M. Hennessey, who has known Law since the early 1980s, adding that in the priesthood, as in other walks of life, there was a time when people \\\"would be kind of slapped on the wrists, so to speak, for these kinds of crimes.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"Law, \\\"like so many people, came to believe that you could just send a priest away to a treatment facility and as long as he came back with a good report, then he was ready to be thrown back into the front lines,\\\" Hennessey said. \\\"And then [he] found out the hard way that that didn't work.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"Law had barely been seen or heard since he left Boston for the Vatican in 2004, facing potential criminal charges. At the Holy See, he served as archpriest of a basilica until 2011. His last years were likely filled with both pain and penance.\",\n",
      "        \"As Boston businessman, philanthropist and former Law confidant Jack Connors, notes, Catholicism teaches that all sins can be forgiven. \\\"I think a lot of us have crossed a bridge here, and forgiven Cardinal Law's decisions that put children in harm's way,\\\" he said. \\\"But I don't think any of us are ever going to forget it.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"The ultimate judgment, Connors added, will come from a higher authority.\",\n",
      "        \"Pope Francis, during his weekly general audience on Wednesday, did not mention Law's passing, but the pontiff \\\"was expected to send an official telegram of condolence later in the day and celebrate Law's funeral Mass, an honor accorded to all Rome-based cardinals,\\\" The Associated Press reports.\"\n",

The agency described Trump, according to one translation, as a \\\"lunatic old man.\\\" Tensions between the two nations had been heightened for months at that point, with North Korea testing missiles and demonstrating its nuclear capabilities and <a href=\\\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/21/552756716/kim-jong-un-issues-statement-on-trump-a-frightened-dog-barks-louder\\\">Trump using increasingly fiery rhetoric</a>.

In the first weekend of controversy after Trump referred to players who kneel during the anthem as a \\\"son of a b****,\\\" Kraft put out a statement saying he was \\\"<a href=\\\"https://www.npr.org/2017/09/25/553539767/how-every-nfl-team-responded-to-trump-s-national-anthem-protest-comments\\\">deeply disappointed</a>\\\" by the tone of Trump's comments and spoke up for the players. \",\n",

There might be a clue in the context. The night before Trump posted the tweet, a federal judge blocked his travel ban executive order.

      "        \"In 2004, after three decades of serving Slovakian-style holiday dinners, my grandmother declared that she was done. Since no single person could match Grandmom's culinary prowess, the rest of the family did our best to divide up her dishes. For our Christmas Eve meal, my father learned to make the opening course\\u2014a lima bean soup. We purchased the dessert, a nut roll called<em> kolachi</em>, from a nearby Ukrainian church. For our main course, <em>pierogi</em>, I took the lead. I was entirely unprepared.\",\n",
      "        \"Pierogi look simple enough. These half-circle-shaped dumplings are made from dough stuffed with filling and boiled. The filling varies across the Central and Eastern European countries where pierogi originate. There are savory fillings like sauerkraut, meat, or mushrooms, and sweet ones like apricot or cherry. We stick to two classics \\u2014 cheesy mashed potatoes and prune.\",\n",
      "        \"As is traditional in many Slavic families with Catholic roots, my grandmother made meatless pierogi on Christmas Eve, having learned the tradition from her mother, who learned from hers. She made pierogi only on Christmas Eve because it was just too much work to muster the energy for on any other day.\",\n",
      "        \"With lights dimmed and candles lit, a dozen of us spanning four generations passed bowls of pierogi around the table as Christmas songs played in the next room. Grandmom sat closest to the kitchen, ready to hop up the instant she noticed the melted butter \\u2014 our sole pierogi topping \\u2014 running low. I sat next to my brother, three years younger, as he attempted to consume one pierogi for each year of his life \\u2014 a tradition that, remarkably, he maintained through age 15.\",\n",
      "        \"I was passed the pierogi reigns over the next in line \\u2014 my father and his two brothers \\u2014 based on very limited qualifications: As a thirteen-year-old, I had once spent the day of December 24<sup>th</sup> in my grandparents' kitchen. While others had pinched a few pierogi closed over the years, I was the only one who had watched from start to finish. But \\\"watched\\\" was the key word.\",\n",
      "        \"My grandmother was a perfectionist. (I always smile when I get to the end of her carrot cake recipe and find her handwritten note: \\\"Don't overbake or under bake.\\\") And she worked quickly. She had a couple of hundred pierogi to make, plus the lima bean soup and a turkey dinner for the following day. Any attempts I made to pitch in felt like getting in the way. She coached me through kneading a couple of batches of dough and then she and my grandfather\\u2014 an expert pierogi sealer \\u2014 took it from there.\",\n",
      "        \"Ten years later, I stood in my parents' kitchen, attempting to replicate her ritual. First, there were the fillings. The prune was simple \\u2014 I steamed some prunes. I couldn't find the potato filling recipe, and my grandmother was no longer in a position to offer instruction. So I whipped up some mashed potatoes and folded in slices of Cooper Sharp American cheese until it tasted like hers.\",\n",
      "        \"It was noon. In five hours our guests, including my grandmother, would arrive. I laid her dough recipe and the ingredients on the kitchen table. My brother stood by, ready to roll out the dough and cut out circles with a coffee tin because I had a vague memory of my grandmother doing the same. I mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl, followed by egg, melted butter and warm water. My hands went in next. And, to my amazement, the feeling was familiar.\",\n",
      "        \"As the dough transformed from sticky paste to a smooth, stretchy ball, I was transported back to Grandmom's kitchen and the feeling of her hands training mine to fold the dough over and push it back down. I was pretty sure I'd nailed it.\",\n",
      "        \"My brother rolled and cut out the dough. I tucked some potato filling into a cutout and pinched the edges as I'd seen my grandparents do. I made more dough. My mother, father, and uncle joined in the pierogi pinching. And four hours later, we had done it, or so we thought.\",\n",
      "        \"Grandmom walked in to find a hundred unboiled pierogi in rows on the kitchen table. My great uncle asked if we'd bought them from the Ukrainian church. \\\"We made them,\\\" I said, and watched as my grandmother's eyebrows raised in delight.\",\n",
      "        \"But pierogi victory was not ours that year. Either I imagined the coffee tin or my grandmother had used a smaller one because these pierogi, once boiled, swelled to massive proportions with the filling seeping out into the boiling water. That night, we ate sad empty pockets of rubbery dough. I felt frustrated that my grandmother hadn't taught me her techniques. But I finally understood why she was so insistent on getting every step exactly right.\",\n",
      "        \"Keeping pierogi on the table was a way of keeping a defining part of Grandmom \\u2014 and our family \\u2014 in our lives. But the weight of holding up that tradition felt enormous. I wanted to get it right.\",\n",
      "        \"The next year we fixed the size issue by swapping the coffee tin for a pint glass. The following year we perfected the texture by rolling the dough thinner. But far too many pierogi still spilled their contents. There had to be something wrong with our sealing technique and we all had ideas about how to fix it.\",\n",
      "        \"My father crimped the edges with a fork. My brother rolled the edges, then crimped. My mother pinched as I did, but never as uniformly as I wanted her to. In later years my husband joined in, also a subscriber to the fork-crimping school. We looked at each other's pierogi with suspicion, and were each convinced when a filling-less pierogi made it to the plate that someone else's technique was to blame.\",\n",
      "        \"Channeling my grandmother, I wanted everyone to keep their hands off the pierogi. But the truth is, I needed their help. And eventually, the great pierogi debate became part of the tradition.\",\n",
      "        \"Then, last Christmas Eve, after 12 years of trial and error, I noticed a step in the recipe that I had overlooked. Soon after dropping pierogi into the boiling water, we were supposed to reduce the heat. We adjusted the temperature and lost not a single one. They weren't as tasty as hers, but they were darn close.\",\n",
      "        \"I wish Grandmom had lived to see us get our family dish right. She passed away four years ago. \\\"Christmas Eve dinner was her thing and the pierogi were the star of the show and they couldn't be wrong. That was unacceptable,\\\" my uncle recently recalled.\",\n",
      "        \"This Christmas Eve, I expect the pierogi to turn out fine. But if they don't, I've learned that for our family what is most unacceptable is Christmas Eve without pierogi, however imperfect they may be. I think my grandmother would agree.\",\n",

Over the years, millions of cat mummies were offered \\u2014 and not just to goddesses. \\\"In the 1890s, people from England went to Egypt and they collected all these mummies.

      "        \"This week Trump judicial nominee Matthew Petersen withdrew his name, amid controversy. It was the third such withdrawal in 10 days. Even so, President Trump's record on filling judicial vacancies has far outdistanced his predecessors.\",\n",
      "        \"Trump, aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has won confirmation of 12 appeals court nominees. That's more than any president in his first year, and indeed, more than Presidents Obama and George W. Bush combined.\",\n",
      "        \"Part of that success is due to the huge number of judicial vacancies that existed when Trump took office \\u2014 122. That staggering number is due to the fact that Republicans, who controlled the Senate in the last two years of the Obama presidency, confirmed only two appeals court judges \\u2014 a record that dates back to the 1800s.\",\n",
      "        \"Appeals court judges are considered particularly important because, although there are fewer of them, they establish legal precedents in the lower courts. Trial court judges, by contrast, preside over criminal and civil trials in the federal courts, and must abide by the precedents that appeals courts establish.\",\n",
      "        \"<strong>A system gone awry </strong>\",\n",
      "        \"Democrats in the Senate have been unable to slow down or block judicial nominees at every level, starting with the party-line vote in the spring to abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, followed by the swift confirmation of Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\",\n",
      "        \"After Gorsuch was confirmed, there still were some steps left for Democrats to use to block Trump's lower court judges \\u2014 namely the so-called blue-slip system by which nominees traditionally are not considered unless both home state senators return a blue approval slip.\",\n",
      "        \"There have been times in the past when some nominees were moved forward without the blue slips, but they have been relatively rare. Now, however, the system exists mainly in name only. It has become like Swiss cheese, as much holes as cheese. And senators, particularly Democratic senators, are often not consulted about judicial nominations.\",\n",
      "        \"Other checks have gone by the wayside too.\",\n",
      "        \"While the Obama administration sent all its potential nominees to the American Bar Association for rating as to qualifications, the Trump administration has refused to do that prior to nomination. And at the Senate Judiciary Committee, where traditionally appeals court nominees were considered on their own at a hearing, they now are routinely considered with several other judicial nominees, and senators have to pick and choose who they will question in the five or ten minutes allotted.\",\n",
      "        \"The result is that the vetting process at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue has become, as one Senate aide put it, an accident waiting to happen.\",\n",
      "        \"And happen it did this month with three nominees for the federal trial courts.\",\n",
      "        \"Petersen, this week's casualty, had no experience as a trial lawyer. He served on the Federal Election Commission with White House Counsel Don McGahn where the two were considered allies. He withdrew after a <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/SenWhitehouse/status/941484131757838337\\\">video of his confirmation performance went viral</a>.\",\n",
      "        \"Questioned by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., Petersen conceded that he had never tried a case in federal or state court, and that he had never taken a deposition on his own. As the agonizingly painful exchange continued, Petersen was unable to answer even the most basic of questions about the rules of evidence for trials.\",\n",
      "        \"Petersen \\u2014 seeing the handwriting on the wall \\u2014 withdrew.\",\n",
      "        \"It took longer for the handwriting to become clear for Brett Talley, a 36-year-old Justice Department official, ghost hunter and believer in the paranormal.\",\n",
      "        \"He was approved by the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote in November, despite a rare and unanimous unqualified rating by the American Bar Association. But as his nomination sat waiting for a vote by the full Senate, news organizations reported that he had failed to disclose key information required for all nominees on his Senate questionnaire. Specifically, he failed to disclose thousands of controversial blog posts under a pseudonym, including one supporting the early Ku Klux Klan, and failed to disclose that he is married to the chief of staff for White House counsel McGahn.\",\n",
      "        \"Finally, there was Jeffrey Mateer, an outspoken supporter of religious liberty, nominated with the strong support of his home state senator, Ted Cruz of Texas. Shortly after the nomination was announced, gay rights groups called attention to frequent comments Mateer had made calling same-sex marriage \\\"disgusting\\\" and likening it to polygamy and bestiality. Speaking about a lawsuit brought by a transgender student, Mateer, said \\\"it just shows you how Satan's plan is working and the destruction that is going on.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"The three nominees who have withdrawn are not the only ones who could have problems. Damien Schiff, nominated for the Court of Federal Claims, wrote a blog post that called Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy a \\\"judicial prostitute.\\\" Another, Thomas Farr, has been accused of lying about his role in suppressing the black vote in North Carolina. Both have been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and are awaiting confirmation.\",\n",
      "        \"But others have sailed through quickly with GOP support. To cite just one example, John Bush, a prominent Republican lawyer was confirmed in June for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit despite some 400 often intemperate and very political blog posts under a fake name \\u2014 posts that linked to so-called alt-right reports containing conspiracy theories and false information, such as the discredited claim that former President Obama was not born in the United States.\",\n",
      "        \"Pressed at his confirmation hearing by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Bush said he regretted having equated the Supreme Court's 1857 decision upholding slavery with the court's 1973 <em>Roe v. Wade</em> abortion decision, and he maintained that he would have no difficulty following the <em>Roe</em> ruling.\",\n",
      "        \"The breakneck speed of nominations and confirmations makes it sometimes look as though the Senate \\\"will confirm anyone who has a temperature of 98.6,\\\" observes Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar who studies the judicial appointment process. He thinks that the Trump nominees may be \\\"more uniformly conservative\\\" than nominees in previous Republican administrations because Trump has given \\\"freer rein to the [conservative] Federalist Society.\\\"\",\n",
      "        \"While most Americans don't pay much attention to nominations to the federal courts, Wheeler notes that \\\"a strong part of the Republican Party base, more so than the Democratic base, are tuned into judges.\\\" There is \\\"a small group of people for whom this means an awful lot,\\\" he observes.\",\n",
      "        \"Trump promised that part of the GOP during his presidential campaign that he would appoint judges they like. Now he is aggressively seeking to carry out that promise and remake the face of the federal judiciary.\"\n",
