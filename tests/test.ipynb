       "    'value': 'The most memorable part of this holiday <em>shopping</em> should be an amazing deal you found — not having to jump through endless hoops trying to reclaim your identity. U.S. consumers are concerned about their personal information and identities during the holiday season, according to a survey by Discover. But these concerns won\\'t affect how they shop, the survey showed. And Black Friday and Cyber Monday are shiny opportunities for identity thieves.  John Krebs, who heads the Federal Trade Commission\\'s identity theft program, says the days of deals — <em>online</em> and in stores — create even more opportunities to steal consumers\\' information.   Here are some simple tips to protect your personal data. Be aware of your surroundings. It seems like it should go without saing, but the Identity Theft Resource Center says 43 percent of identity theft stems from a stolen wallet, checkbook, credit card, or other physical document. During the hustle and bustle of holiday <em>shopping</em>, keep an eye on your belongings and stay aware of what\\'s going on around you. Be wary of those public, unsecured coffee shop Wi-Fi networks. If you use an unsecured network to log in to an unencrypted site — or a site that uses encryption only on the sign-in page — other users on the network can see what you see and what you send.  \"They could hijack your session and log in as you,\" Krebs says. \"New hacking tools available for free <em>online</em> make this easy, even for users with limited technical know-how.\"  Your personal information and login credentials could be up for grabs. The FTC recommends using a virtual private network (VPN) and changing the settings on your mobile device so it doesn\\'t automatically connect to nearby public Wi-Fi.    Use a credit card instead of a debit card. If your credit card gets stolen and used without your knowledge, it\\'s significantly easier on your wallet than if the same happens with your debit card. The Fair Credit Billing Act says that your maximum liability for unauthorized use of your credit card is $50 — and if you report the loss before your card is used, you aren\\'t responsible for any charges you didn\\'t authorize.  If you report a debit card to your bank as missing before someone uses it, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act says you\\'re not responsible for any unauthorized purchases. But if someone uses your debit card before you can report it as missing, your bank gets to decide how much you\\'ll have to pay for any unauthorized purchases. Beware too-good-to-be-true deals in your inbox. You might receive emails that offer deals at websites of stores you\\'ve shopped at before. Don\\'t click on the link in the email. Instead, go directly to the store\\'s website to confirm that a product\\'s price really is slashed that heavily.  Emails with the intent of phishing you — that is, trying to steal sensitive information like passwords and credit card details — are often disguised as a trustworthy source. \"Identity thieves may create clones of store websites and use an email to bring unaware <em>online</em> shoppers to the fake site to steal personal information if the person buys anything,\" says Tim Cunningham, chief information officer at Grange Insurance. Think carefully about providing your information. Mobile <em>shopping</em> apps are convenient, but they can store your name, address, phone number, email, and credit and debit card details.  Look for apps that are transparent about how they keep your data safe. Never provide confidential information tied to your identity, like your Social Security number or bank account number, to someone claiming to be from a government agency or business. Reputable agencies have other methods to prove that you\\'re you. And, as all consumer protection guides will tell you, don\\'t send cash.  Is someone asking you to wire money immediately for a deal that seems too good to be true, or saying you qualify for a government grant but need to send them a cash fee to receive it? Don\\'t buy it. Scammers will ask you to pay in ways that let them get cash fast — and make it extremely difficult for you to get your money back. The FTC has resources available to consumers who have questions about protecting their personal information, or who suspect they have been the victims of identity theft.

       "    'value': 'There are some big companies out there that you\\'ve probably never heard of, that know more about you than you can imagine. They\\'re called data brokers, and they collect all sorts of information — names, addresses, income, where you go on the Internet and who you connect with <em>online.</em> That information is then sold to other companies. There are few regulations governing these brokers. Data brokers have been around for a long time, collecting information about your magazine and newspaper subscriptions. They know whether you prefer dogs or cats. From public records they can tell if you drive a Ford or a Subaru or if you\\'ve declared bankruptcy. But the Internet upped the ante considerably. Think of all that personal data you share on Facebook, or your <em>online</em> <em>shopping.</em> According to Julie Brill, who recently stepped down as a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, these companies share just about everything. \"It\\'s what Web pages we visit, where we\\'re <em>shopping</em>, who we\\'re interfacing with on social media — all of that information is available to be collected by entities that park themselves on the various websites,\" Brill said. Once these companies collect the information, the data brokers package and sell it — sometimes to other brokers, sometimes to businesses — that then use the information to target ads to consumers. And it\\'s a lucrative industry. One of the largest brokers, Acxiom, reported over $800 million in revenue last year. When the FTC studied data brokers two years ago, it found that brokers take the information they gleaned about consumers and use it to put us into categories. Some of the categories are innocuous — pet owner, or winter sports enthusiast. But Brill says others were more problematic, like \"single mom struggling in an urban setting\" or \"people who did not speak English and felt more comfortable speaking in Spanish\" or \"gamblers.\" \"And so the concern is not only the fact that these profiles are being created, but how are they being used,\" Brill said. Say, for instance, you do an <em>online</em> search for heart disease or diabetes. Depending upon the website, that information can go to ad networks and analytics companies. If the contents of that heart disease or diabetes search end up with a data broker, that information could then be added to your digital biography. \"That becomes a part of your profile and others see that and can market to you based on that information,\" Brill said. And there\\'s little to stop data brokers from using the information they\\'ve gathered from us in whatever way they please, says Jeff Chester, a privacy advocate and director of the Center for Digital Democracy. \"Because there are no <em>online</em> privacy laws in the United States, there\\'s no stop sign, there\\'s no go slow sign, there\\'s no crossing guard. The message is anything goes,\" Chester said. Like Chester, former FTC Commissioner Brill says legislation is needed to make the industry more transparent. She says there should be a website where consumers could see what data has been collected about them and correct it or block it from being used. Some individual companies, like Acxiom, do this. And the industry does have voluntary guidelines to limit how information is used. Xenia Boone is the vice president for corporate and social responsibility at the Direct Marketing Association, which represents many data brokers. She says companies are not creating \"dossiers\" about consumers. Boone says marketing companies and fundraiser organizations \"are working with data companies in order to get the right information about potential prospects because they need to go out there, they need the data in order to reach someone.\" A marketing industry website, aboutads.info, lets consumers opt out of having some ads sent to their browsers. Consumers can also block individual ads by clicking on that little triangle in the upper right hand corner of many of them. You can also install an ad blocker and clear the cookies from your browser. But blocking ads is one thing, keeping your information away from the data brokers is much harder to do. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  We share something about ourselves most of the time we go <em>online.</em> It might be our names or addresses. Or it could be something less obvious, like our location, income or favorite stores. On this week\\'s All Tech Considered, what happens to that data. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIEGEL: An entire industry collects and sells <em>online</em> data. As NPR\\'s Brian Naylor reports, these data brokers have few regulations to follow. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Data brokers have been around for a long time, collecting information about your magazine and newspaper subscriptions. They know whether you prefer dogs or cats. From public records, they can tell if you drive a Ford or a Subaru, or if you\\'ve declared bankruptcy. But the internet upped the ante considerably. Think of all that personal data you share on Facebook or your <em>online</em> <em>shopping.</em> Yeah, I think I\\'ll get those shoes. Julie Brill recently stepped down from the Federal Trade Commission. JULIE BRILL: It\\'s what web pages we visit, where we\\'re <em>shopping</em>, who we\\'re interfacing with on social media. All of that information is available to be collected by entities that park themselves on the various websites. NAYLOR: Once they\\'ve collected it, the data brokers package and sell that information - sometimes to other brokers, sometimes to businesses that use it to target ads to consumers. And it\\'s a lucrative industry. One of the largest brokers, Acxiom, reported over $800 million in revenues last year. Two years ago, the FTC studied data brokers. One thing it found was that brokers take the information they\\'ve gleaned about consumers and use it to put us into categories. Some of the categories are innocuous - pet owner, or winter sports enthusiast. But Brill says others were more problematic. BRILL: Single mom struggling in a - in an urban setting or people who did not speak English and felt more comfortable speaking in Spanish or people who were gamblers. And so the concern is, you know, not only the fact that these profiles are being created, but how are they being used? NAYLOR: Say, for instance, I go <em>online</em> and do a web search for heart disease or diabetes. BRILL: That information, depending upon the website, can go to ad networks, can go to analytics companies, which then will put that information into a profile about you - if it\\'s a data broker - saying you have an interest in heart condition issues or diabetes issues. That becomes a part of your profile. And others see that and can market to you based on that information. NAYLOR: And there\\'s little to stop data brokers from using the information they\\'ve gathered from us in whatever way they please, says Jeff Chester, a privacy advocate and director of the Center for Digital Democracy. JEFF CHESTER: Because there are no privacy - <em>online</em> privacy laws in the United States, there\\'s no stop sign. There\\'s no go slow sign. There\\'s no, you know, crossing guard.

       "  'bodyText': 'There are some big companies out there that you\\'ve probably never heard of, that know more about you than you can imagine. They\\'re called data brokers, and they collect all sorts of information — names, addresses, income, where you go on the Internet and who you connect with online. That information is then sold to other companies. There are few regulations governing these brokers. Data brokers have been around for a long time, collecting information about your magazine and newspaper subscriptions. They know whether you prefer dogs or cats. From public records they can tell if you drive a Ford or a Subaru or if you\\'ve declared bankruptcy. But the Internet upped the ante considerably. Think of all that personal data you share on Facebook, or your online shopping. According to Julie Brill, who recently stepped down as a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, these companies share just about everything. \"It\\'s what Web pages we visit, where we\\'re shopping, who we\\'re interfacing with on social media — all of that information is available to be collected by entities that park themselves on the various websites,\" Brill said. Once these companies collect the information, the data brokers package and sell it — sometimes to other brokers, sometimes to businesses — that then use the information to target ads to consumers. And it\\'s a lucrative industry. One of the largest brokers, Acxiom, reported over $800 million in revenue last year. When the FTC studied data brokers two years ago, it found that brokers take the information they gleaned about consumers and use it to put us into categories. Some of the categories are innocuous — pet owner, or winter sports enthusiast. But Brill says others were more problematic, like \"single mom struggling in an urban setting\" or \"people who did not speak English and felt more comfortable speaking in Spanish\" or \"gamblers.\" \"And so the concern is not only the fact that these profiles are being created, but how are they being used,\" Brill said. Say, for instance, you do an online search for heart disease or diabetes. Depending upon the website, that information can go to ad networks and analytics companies. If the contents of that heart disease or diabetes search end up with a data broker, that information could then be added to your digital biography. \"That becomes a part of your profile and others see that and can market to you based on that information,\" Brill said. And there\\'s little to stop data brokers from using the information they\\'ve gathered from us in whatever way they please, says Jeff Chester, a privacy advocate and director of the Center for Digital Democracy. \"Because there are no online privacy laws in the United States, there\\'s no stop sign, there\\'s no go slow sign, there\\'s no crossing guard. The message is anything goes,\" Chester said. Like Chester, former FTC Commissioner Brill says legislation is needed to make the industry more transparent. She says there should be a website where consumers could see what data has been collected about them and correct it or block it from being used. Some individual companies, like Acxiom, do this. And the industry does have voluntary guidelines to limit how information is used. Xenia Boone is the vice president for corporate and social responsibility at the Direct Marketing Association, which represents many data brokers. She says companies are not creating \"dossiers\" about consumers. Boone says marketing companies and fundraiser organizations \"are working with data companies in order to get the right information about potential prospects because they need to go out there, they need the data in order to reach someone.\" A marketing industry website, aboutads.info, lets consumers opt out of having some ads sent to their browsers.

       "    'value': 'Black Friday <em>shopping</em> at brick-and-mortar stores in the United States was down about 7 percent from a year ago, according to ShopperTrak, but more purchases on Thanksgiving Day nearly made up the difference. Meanwhile, <em>online</em> retailers recorded double-digit year-on-year increases in sales. ShopperTrak says Friday store sales hit $9.1 billion, but that shoppers spent $3.2 billion on Thanksgiving — a 24 percent increase for sales on that day from over last year. Overall, it represented a 0.5 percent drop from last year. The New York Times says: \"ShopperTrak, a consumer analytics firm based in Chicago, warned that its estimates were preliminary, and that shifting spending patterns meant that holiday sales were now dispersed over a longer period. Retailers have been offering deep discounts well before their sales on Friday, and many stores moved the start of those offers to Thursday evening.\" A separate survey by IBM showed a 9.5 percent jump on Black Friday and a 14.3 percent increase on Thanksgiving Day for <em>online</em> sales over the same period last year. Amazon.com saw a 24 percent increase in sales over the two days and it predicts that its Cyber Monday sales will show an even bigger increase.

       "  'bodyText': 'Black Friday shopping at brick-and-mortar stores in the United States was down about 7 percent from a year ago, according to ShopperTrak, but more purchases on Thanksgiving Day nearly made up the difference. Meanwhile, online retailers recorded double-digit year-on-year increases in sales. ShopperTrak says Friday store sales hit $9.1 billion, but that shoppers spent $3.2 billion on Thanksgiving — a 24 percent increase for sales on that day from over last year. Overall, it represented a 0.5 percent drop from last year. The New York Times says: \"ShopperTrak, a consumer analytics firm based in Chicago, warned that its estimates were preliminary, and that shifting spending patterns meant that holiday sales were now dispersed over a longer period. Retailers have been offering deep discounts well before their sales on Friday, and many stores moved the start of those offers to Thursday evening.\" A separate survey by IBM showed a 9.5 percent jump on Black Friday and a 14.3 percent increase on Thanksgiving Day for online sales over the same period last year. Amazon.com saw a 24 percent increase in sales over the two days and it predicts that its Cyber Monday sales will show an even bigger increase. The National Retail Federation is predicting that this will be the strongest holiday shopping season in the last three years. ',\n",

If so, you\\'re not alone. \\'Tis the season for many over-worked Americans to fret over how they\\'re going to throw together a huge meal in a limited window of time. Earlier this month, The Salt took your pulse on cooking for the holidays with an (unscientific) survey. About 36 percent of you said you consider this season of cooking to be fun, while 9 percent said it\\'s stressful. But for the majority — 55 percent — holiday cooking is equal parts fun and stressful. It\\'s not so much the act of cooking that seems to make us anxious, but rather getting it all done in time. When we asked readers what kind of tips they\\'d like, many requested help with shortening the time and preparation of the Thanksgiving meal. It\\'s 2014, and the Internet is primed to come to your rescue by helping you buy back some of the time you might spend in a parking lot or standing in line. Fortunately, the options for ordering prepared food or ingredients <em>online</em> have improved dramatically the last few years. And <em>online</em> retailers are adapting accordingly. \"There\\'s been a shift toward fresh, individual meal components – organic potatoes, all-natural kale and fresh Brussels sprouts – and a shift away from pre-prepared, fully cooked dinners,\" Tony Stallone, Peapod\\'s vice president of Fresh Markets, tells The Salt. If You Don\\'t Want To Cook At All: Grocery stores have been offering fully cooked birds, pies and sides for many years. But the selection and quality of these items is improving, as is the ease of ordering. Whole Foods Market says last year\\'s Thanksgiving orders exceeded 100,000 and they\\'re on track to surpass that this year. But be prepared to pay more than what you\\'d pay for DIY Thanksgiving. An organic turkey dinner from Whole Foods with all the fixings like mashed potatoes, biscuits, mushroom stuffing and more for six to eight people will run you $129.99. You can also pick up a non-organic turkey dinner for $10 less. If you\\'re not going organic, Kroger\\'s offers an Express Turkey Dinner for six for $44.99, while Albertsons has a Holiday Dinner you can order <em>online</em> that feeds six to eight people. Publix offers a Regular Turkey Thanksgiving Dinner with turkey, gravy, potatoes and cranberry sauce for seven to 10 people for $39.99. If you live near a Safeway, you can pick up a complete Thanksgiving dinner for six to eight people with turkey, ham, or prime rib, with just 24 hours\\' notice. However, beware of their Holiday Hotline number for ordering – it was closed Tuesday morning when I called after 9:00 a.m. If you just need a few ingredients and live in a place that has Instacart, you can get a delivery. The company\\'s partnership with Whole Foods allows for same-day delivery within mere hours, even on Thanksgiving day. Instacart delivery is free on the first order and $3.99 for a two-hour delivery or $5.99 for a one-hour delivery. The two have even paired up to curate useful Instacart shipments like \"Thanksgiving Shortcuts.\" Williams-Sonoma If you\\'re game for something showy and need the meal shipped, you can get a designer dinner from Williams-Sonoma, created by Food Network chef Tyler Florence. The dinner serves 12 and will arrive by the Wednesday before Thanksgiving if you order by Friday, Nov. 21. But it comes with a hefty price tag: $399.95. If You Want To Cook And Buy Local: Local Harvest Type in your address at LocalHarvest and the site will show you where you can find nearby meats, produce, dairy and other items produced nearby. It\\'s a good place to find staples like eggs as well as the more obscure products to spice up your meal like Lemon Maine Sea Salt. Some products come with free shipping, indicated by a small badge on the product\\'s page. (If you\\'re planning to order a turkey from a local farm, do it pronto, as most farms\\' supplies are by now running low.) GoodEggs If you live in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, New Orleans or Brooklyn, you can order local produce with free shipping on orders over $30. From hand-baked bread to cold brew coffee to flowers for the table, GoodEggs promises your products are coming from a vendor who supports sustainable agriculture. If You Just Need Ingredients Fast: Google Express Google Express can get you last-minute basics (like flour, sugar and breadcrumbs) or condiments from Costco, Giant Food or Walgreens. Best of all, same-day delivery is available every day of the week. But you won\\'t find perishable products on the list; get your turkey elsewhere. Normally, shipping is $5 per order (except alcohol which is $3 per order), but with their current promotion, you can get three months free delivery on certain orders over $15. If You Want Gourmet Sides OpenSky For those with gourmet taste, take a spin on OpenSky, which touts products like the Vegan Divas Deluxe Package ($115), an easy, if costly, answer for hosts looking for desserts to please everyone\\'s diet. FoodShed The site FoodShed will find you everything from aged artisanal cheeses to Brussels sprout relish from small producers. The downside is that while it artfully curates the food, it\\'s not a marketplace. Instead, it will direct you to find the product locally or order direct from the supplier. If You Dislike <em>Online</em> <em>Shopping</em> Amazon Make it easy on yourself by sticking with an <em>online</em> ordering service you know. Amazon sells food three ways: via individual food items, PrimePantry and AmazonFresh (if you live in a region where it\\'s available). Amazon tells us the most popular products from their Thanksgiving store include coffee and gourmet hot cocoa, baking supplies like vanilla extract and sides like canned veggies, chicken broth and gravy.

So before you hit \"Add to Cart\" on one of the sites above, check out the iPad app 222 Million Tons to make sure you\\'re not overdoing it. The app calculates how much food a family can reasonably eat depending on the number of people and their diet. If You Want To Potluck ThingToBring App The Salt\\'s unscientific survey found that 45 percent of holiday meals today are potluck-style with different people contributing to the meal. In addition, 66 percent of you said that potlucks make things easier.

       "    'value': 'It started with the iPod. In 2001, Apple promised to do away with stacks of CDs and put 1,000 songs in your pocket. Thirteen years later, the music industry is unrecognizable: Most brick-and-mortar record stores have closed, and a pocket-size hard drive filled with music seems quaint in a world with YouTube and Spotify. We didn\\'t know it at the time, but the introduction of the iPod began Apple\\'s shift from Macs to consumer electronics, which resuscitated the ailing computer-maker\\'s fortunes and helped transform it into the world\\'s most valuable company. Next on Apple\\'s list of industries to shake up is something much more basic: how we pay for things countless times a day. Apple is taking aim at what\\'s in our wallet. Our cash and credit cards, as well <em>online</em> <em>shopping.</em> Apple Pay uses what\\'s known as a near-field chip to communicate with payment sensors at store checkouts. It works with Touch ID, a system built into recent iPhones that uses your fingerprint as a pass code. And Apple Pay promises to make transactions more secure at a time when major retailers, including Target and Home Depot, have reported massive breaches of their payment systems. Apple\\'s foray into e-payments was predicted long ago, and it is not the first phone-maker to get into it. Windows and Android phones already have NFC chips for payments. But they haven\\'t caught on. John-Kurt Pliniussen, associate professor of Internet marketing and innovation at Queens School of Business in Ontario, says Apple\\'s entry into e-payments means magnetic strip credit and debit cards are now \"state of the ark\" — about as relevant as Noah\\'s floodworthy vessel. \"The question is how quickly this will dominate the world, because it will,\" Pliniussen says. Apple has built its corporate empire by making money off apps, music and devices. That got us thinking: What\\'s Apple Inc. going to get out of Apple Pay? iWant Susan Crawford, an Internet policy expert and visiting professor at Harvard Law School, sees the payment system as a way of locking in increased loyalty for already adoring Apple fans. If Apple can leverage its customers\\' pre-existing trust to help consumers jump over their privacy concerns associated with e-payments, she says, the company may have made one more reason for users to keep their iPhones clutched tightly in their hand at all times. \"Really this is all about affection for these devices, which are literally very close to people\\'s hearts,\" Crawford says. Ryan McInerney, president of Visa, framed Apple Pay as a win-win for both Apple and credit card companies. \"Buying things on your mobile phones is not as easy as it should be,\" he says. Apple \"wants to engage their customers on their devices as much as possible.\" Card companies think that keeping your beloved, trusted phone in your hand longer, and closer to your heart, means you\\'ll spend more money with it — that\\'s good for Apple and good for Visa, MasterCard and the like. Swipe Fees Apple reportedly negotiated a cut from the \"swipe fees\" that card companies charge merchants when you use your card, but Visa\\'s McInerney would not comment on what, if any, agreements were made. It\\'s not likely we will hear an official statement on how much Apple is getting each time a consumer taps a phone on a sensor. Credit card swipe fees are something of a trade secret for companies like Visa and MasterCard — a class-action lawsuit that alleged swipe fee price fixing was settled in 2012. Many retailers say the fees are still too high. Wal-Mart is suing Visa after opting out of the settlement. Apple Has Your Credit Card Number Apple already has what analysts believe is the largest cache of consumer credit card numbers in the world. In a conference call with investors this April, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company had 800 million iTunes accounts, the majority of which had active credit cards stored on them. (That\\'s up from 575 million in June 2013.) For new Apple Pay users, the default payment will be the card that is already stored in their iTunes account. That\\'s one less hoop for consumers to jump through before they can start tapping and buying. Security In the past, Apple succeeded in making money by presenting more attractive alternatives to industries under attack. In 2001, the music industry was battered by music-sharing services like Napster. The iTunes Store\\'s growing clout forced companies to play with Apple and agree to its payment scheme. Today, credit card companies like Visa and MasterCard are scrambling to implement PIN verification systems to respond to repeated massive breaches of consumer data. Credit card transaction fees differ based on whether a card is \"present\" or \"not present.\" This means that buying something <em>online</em> assesses a higher fee as a type of insurance to hedge against the increased risk of fraud in <em>online</em> transactions. In his keynote address Tuesday, Cook made the security argument by saying the magnetic stripe and 16 digits of plastic credit cards are \"outdated and vulnerable.\" Cook also noted the vast sum of money Apple could potentially dip into: $4 trillion per year charged to credit and debit cards in the U.S. alone. Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard, also hinted that security was a key appeal. \"We see value being generated in many ways,\" McLaughlin says, including \"fraud that can be eliminated.\" But Crawford, the Internet policy expert, is not so sure the win-win is a permanent win for Visa, MasterCard and the others. \"[Credit card companies] are powerful enough that Apple needs them more right now than they need Apple,\" she says. \"But the tables may turn as Apple becomes more like a card processing network.\" Indeed, Cook hinted at the company\\'s ambitions in an interview with ABC News. When asked whether Apple had killed the credit card, Cook said, \"I think that we put a dagger in it.\" Tim Fitzsimons is a reporter based in Washington, D.C.

Thirteen years later, the music industry is unrecognizable: Most brick-and-mortar record stores have closed, and a pocket-size hard drive filled with music seems quaint in a world with YouTube and Spotify. We didn\\'t know it at the time, but the introduction of the iPod began Apple\\'s shift from Macs to consumer electronics, which resuscitated the ailing computer-maker\\'s fortunes and helped transform it into the world\\'s most valuable company.

It works with Touch ID, a system built into recent iPhones that uses your fingerprint as a pass code. And Apple Pay promises to make transactions more secure at a time when major retailers, including Target and Home Depot, have reported massive breaches of their payment systems. Apple\\'s foray into e-payments was predicted long ago, and it is not the first phone-maker to get into it. Windows and Android phones already have NFC chips for payments. But they haven\\'t caught on. John-Kurt Pliniussen, associate professor of Internet marketing and innovation at Queens School of Business in Ontario, says Apple\\'s entry into e-payments means magnetic strip credit and debit cards are now \"state of the ark\" — about as relevant as Noah\\'s floodworthy vessel. \"The question is how quickly this will dominate the world, because it will,\" Pliniussen says.

Instead of basing the price of a package just on weight, starting in January 2015, FedEx will factor in size, too. Analysts predict UPS will likely follow suit. Here and Now’s Jeremy Hobson talks to Sucharita Mulpuru, retail analyst at Forrester Research, about how this could affect <em>online</em> retailers like Amazon, and how they approach both packaging and shipping. Guest\\n\\nSucharita Mulpuru, retail analyst at Forrester Research. She tweets @smulpuru.\\n JEREMY HOBSON, HOST:  It's HERE AND NOW. The big question in the world of e-commerce is will UPS follow FedEx in overhauling its pricing for ground shipping? FedEx announced last week that instead of basing the price of a package just on weight, starting next year, FedEx is going to factor in size, too. That could have a big impact on <em>online</em> retailers like Amazon and how much they charge all of us to ship things. Joining us now from WFAE in Charlotte, North Carolina, is Sucharita Mulpuru, retail analyst at Forrester Research. Sucharita, thanks for being here. SUCHARITA MULPURU: Thanks, Jeremy. HOBSON: Well, how significant is this change from FedEx? MULPURU: Well, it is and it isn't. The main change is this announcement that certain packages that they ship via ground are going to have this dimensional weight component. So instead of these packages just being assessed, their fee based on weight alone, it also takes into account how large of a package it is. They've already had that type of measurement and pricing scheme for their express packages and their large ground shipments. So it's just adding that scheme to an additional layer, is how it's been presented. HOBSON: Which means it wouldn't make sense for me, for example, order a bunch of different pairs of shoes from Amazon and then send back the ones that I don't like. MULPURU: That is the big question is who does it affect and what types of packages does it affect? It seems that it would affect packages that are less than three cubic feet that seem to have a lot of air in them or anything that there is a large space that it takes in a box, but it may not be heavy because now you're going to have to pay more for the actual size of the box. So it could anything. It could be like a toaster, for instance. That's actually what was an example cited in the Wall Street Journal the other day, of one particular items that has a lot of cube, that's the term in the carrier industry, that represents the size of the package. And that would actually be an item, for instance, that could be up to 40 percent more expensive to ship now because of the volume that it takes in a truck. HOBSON: Or it could be toilet paper or something that is very big but doesn't weigh very much. MULPURU: Exactly, and I think that the analysis there for toilet paper was that that, too, would probably be about 30 to 40 percent more expensive if the shipper were assessed this new rack rate. Of course, if you're a large-volume shipper, you're always going to get discounts, and you're not likely to have to pay the rack rate that you and I would have to pay if we were to go walk into a FedEx office location. ROBIN YOUNG, HOST:  So why is FedEx doing this now? MULPURU: I think there are some larger issues with the carrier industry overall and the fact that sectors like e-commerce are growing very, very rapidly, and there's a little bit of as supply and demand imbalance, in which there is rapid growth with e-commerce packages, and there hasn't been enough of a cost increase to manage some of that growth. So what you see is sometimes inefficiency in the way that the packages may be configured or the size of the boxes that shippers may be using, and part of this I think is to create a little bit more efficiency from the shipper's standpoint, and also to, you know, wherever there is a need to ship these packages to make sure that there is, you know, a level of profitability that is needed to make it worth everybody's time. HOBSON: Sure, but isn't FedEx worried that doing something like this might scare off Amazon, and Amazon may decide OK, fine, we're going to ship all of our packages through UPS? MULPURU: Well, there's likely to be some type of equilibrium in the market, particularly amongst the larger carriers, I expect. I mean, typically when one carrier has a change in their prices, the other carriers often will go in lockstep for the same type of offer. So that's probably what is going to be the more realistic scenario. Now, that does raise a question of what are an e-commerce company's other options, and there are a number of regional carriers that are burgeoning, and they basically will do the last mile, and they'll deliver packages for some of these larger e-commerce companies, and they underprice the major carriers all the time. HOBSON: But if companies like Amazon, e-commerce companies are going to stick with the shippers that will raise the prices, where does that leave them? How much of an impact does it have on their sales, and how much of an impact does it have on people that shop on Amazon? MULPURU: Well, it's a good question, and I don't know that we're going to know the exactly answers. Now, you know, as I said I think that there are two big effects that price changes like this have. One, is that it makes retailers much, much more efficient. And what you end up having is instead of, for instance, an item that probably doesn't make sense to be shipped in a box, you may have shipper in a poly bag for instance, like clothes. Clothes really don't need to be shipped in a box, and there - it's more efficient, it's cheaper. You can squeeze more into a truck when you poly-bag certain items. So I think part of the incentive here is to drive companies to greater efficiency in their packaging. Amazon's already pretty efficient. I mean, they actually have optimized box cutters that can create boxes of new sizes depending on the item that goes into an order. But - you know, and maybe this could even make them more efficient with respect to that. But the other opportunity here is in fact to really, I think, create a little bit more of a market that balances supply and demand and really, really passes the true cost of something like shipping toilet paper onto the retailer, ultimately the customer, because it may not always make sense to purchase certain items <em>online.</em> And I think that as consumers, we've lost a little bit of sight of that because there have been so many free shipping offers, and there may not have been a lot of the visibility into the cost accounting and some of the inefficiencies that existed in doing things like shipping these very low-margin, low-cost items to your home. HOBSON: Sucharita Mulpuru, while we have you, let me ask you about another story that has Amazon in the news, about the idea that knockoff products are rising to the top when you search for items on Amazon. This is being reported in the Wall Street Journal this week. What can you tell us about that? MULPURU: The idea, and some of the speculation comes from the fact that there is a process in the Amazon distribution centers call co-binning, in which there is merchandise from different sellers, from different companies that all get associated together. So, say for instance there is a KitchenAid mixer, and it may be sold by five or six different companies, it all gets classified as the same KitchenAid mixer. And when somebody purchases that product, the first KitcheAid mixer that's closest to the customer gets pulled and shipped, and unfortunately because there hasn't been that clear demarcation of which item was - initially belonged to which seller, in some cases some sellers may have counterfeit product or lower-quality product or product that, you know, because the condition of that product isn't fully known, the consumer may purchase a product, and it could get shipped from one of these sellers that may not be all that reputable. HOBSON: So is it time to end co-mingling? MULPURU: It should be time to end co-mingling for this reason because it is very, very difficult to know exactly what is in every single box and to manage the integrity of all of that merchandise, especially when you have the dozens of distribution centers that Amazon has and the millions and millions of products that they carry on their site. But, you know, I mean, that's something that, you know, there are tremendous efficiencies that come out of that process. There are also significant risks, and there's a downside associated with them. HOBSON: Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research, joining us to talk all about Amazon. Sucharita, thanks so much. MULPURU: Thanks Jeremy.

And I think that as consumers, we've lost a little bit of sight of that because there have been so many free shipping offers, and there may not have been a lot of the visibility into the cost accounting and some of the inefficiencies that existed in doing things like shipping these very low-margin, low-cost items to your home. HOBSON: Sucharita Mulpuru, while we have you, let me ask you about another story that has Amazon in the news, about the idea that knockoff products are rising to the top when you search for items on Amazon. This is being reported in the Wall Street Journal this week. What can you tell us about that? MULPURU: The idea, and some of the speculation comes from the fact that there is a process in the Amazon distribution centers call co-binning, in which there is merchandise from different sellers, from different companies that all get associated together. So, say for instance there is a KitchenAid mixer, and it may be sold by five or six different companies, it all gets classified as the same KitchenAid mixer. And when somebody purchases that product, the first KitcheAid mixer that's closest to the customer gets pulled and shipped, and unfortunately because there hasn't been that clear demarcation of which item was - initially belonged to which seller, in some cases some sellers may have counterfeit product or lower-quality product or product that, you know, because the condition of that product isn't fully known, the consumer may purchase a product, and it could get shipped from one of these sellers that may not be all that reputable. HOBSON: So is it time to end co-mingling? MULPURU: It should be time to end co-mingling for this reason because it is very, very difficult to know exactly what is in every single box and to manage the integrity of all of that merchandise, especially when you have the dozens of distribution centers that Amazon has and the millions and millions of products that they carry on their site. But, you know, I mean, that's something that, you know, there are tremendous efficiencies that come out of that process. There are also significant risks, and there's a downside associated with them. HOBSON: Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research, joining us to talk all about Amazon. Sucharita, thanks so much. MULPURU: Thanks Jeremy.

       "  'transcript': \"JEREMY HOBSON, HOST:  It's HERE AND NOW. The big question in the world of e-commerce is will UPS follow FedEx in overhauling its pricing for ground shipping? FedEx announced last week that instead of basing the price of a package just on weight, starting next year, FedEx is going to factor in size, too. That could have a big impact on online retailers like Amazon and how much they charge all of us to ship things. Joining us now from WFAE in Charlotte, North Carolina, is Sucharita Mulpuru, retail analyst at Forrester Research. Sucharita, thanks for being here. SUCHARITA MULPURU: Thanks, Jeremy. HOBSON: Well, how significant is this change from FedEx? MULPURU: Well, it is and it isn't. The main change is this announcement that certain packages that they ship via ground are going to have this dimensional weight component. So instead of these packages just being assessed, their fee based on weight alone, it also takes into account how large of a package it is. They've already had that type of measurement and pricing scheme for their express packages and their large ground shipments. So it's just adding that scheme to an additional layer, is how it's been presented. HOBSON: Which means it wouldn't make sense for me, for example, order a bunch of different pairs of shoes from Amazon and then send back the ones that I don't like. MULPURU: That is the big question is who does it affect and what types of packages does it affect? It seems that it would affect packages that are less than three cubic feet that seem to have a lot of air in them or anything that there is a large space that it takes in a box, but it may not be heavy because now you're going to have to pay more for the actual size of the box. So it could anything. It could be like a toaster, for instance. That's actually what was an example cited in the Wall Street Journal the other day, of one particular items that has a lot of cube, that's the term in the carrier industry, that represents the size of the package. And that would actually be an item, for instance, that could be up to 40 percent more expensive to ship now because of the volume that it takes in a truck. HOBSON: Or it could be toilet paper or something that is very big but doesn't weigh very much. MULPURU: Exactly, and I think that the analysis there for toilet paper was that that, too, would probably be about 30 to 40 percent more expensive if the shipper were assessed this new rack rate. Of course, if you're a large-volume shipper, you're always going to get discounts, and you're not likely to have to pay the rack rate that you and I would have to pay if we were to go walk into a FedEx office location. ROBIN YOUNG, HOST:  So why is FedEx doing this now? MULPURU: I think there are some larger issues with the carrier industry overall and the fact that sectors like e-commerce are growing very, very rapidly, and there's a little bit of as supply and demand imbalance, in which there is rapid growth with e-commerce packages, and there hasn't been enough of a cost increase to manage some of that growth. So what you see is sometimes inefficiency in the way that the packages may be configured or the size of the boxes that shippers may be using, and part of this I think is to create a little bit more efficiency from the shipper's standpoint, and also to, you know, wherever there is a need to ship these packages to make sure that there is, you know, a level of profitability that is needed to make it worth everybody's time. HOBSON: Sure, but isn't FedEx worried that doing something like this might scare off Amazon, and Amazon may decide OK, fine, we're going to ship all of our packages through UPS? MULPURU: Well, there's likely to be some type of equilibrium in the market, particularly amongst the larger carriers, I expect. I mean, typically when one carrier has a change in their prices, the other carriers often will go in lockstep for the same type of offer. So that's probably what is going to be the more realistic scenario. Now, that does raise a question of what are an e-commerce company's other options, and there are a number of regional carriers that are burgeoning, and they basically will do the last mile, and they'll deliver packages for some of these larger e-commerce companies, and they underprice the major carriers all the time. HOBSON: But if companies like Amazon, e-commerce companies are going to stick with the shippers that will raise the prices, where does that leave them? How much of an impact does it have on their sales, and how much of an impact does it have on people that shop on Amazon? MULPURU: Well, it's a good question, and I don't know that we're going to know the exactly answers. Now, you know, as I said I think that there are two big effects that price changes like this have. One, is that it makes retailers much, much more efficient. And what you end up having is instead of, for instance, an item that probably doesn't make sense to be shipped in a box, you may have shipper in a poly bag for instance, like clothes. Clothes really don't need to be shipped in a box, and there - it's more efficient, it's cheaper. You can squeeze more into a truck when you poly-bag certain items. So I think part of the incentive here is to drive companies to greater efficiency in their packaging. Amazon's already pretty efficient. I mean, they actually have optimized box cutters that can create boxes of new sizes depending on the item that goes into an order. But - you know, and maybe this could even make them more efficient with respect to that. But the other opportunity here is in fact to really, I think, create a little bit more of a market that balances supply and demand and really, really passes the true cost of something like shipping toilet paper onto the retailer, ultimately the customer, because it may not always make sense to purchase certain items online. And I think that as consumers, we've lost a little bit of sight of that because there have been so many free shipping offers, and there may not have been a lot of the visibility into the cost accounting and some of the inefficiencies that existed in doing things like shipping these very low-margin, low-cost items to your home.

Allen (June 12, 1957 \\u2013 June 27, 2017) died of cancer at age 60. A vital contributor to contemporary jazz, she was known for uniting disparate styles of jazz, and her style found its roots everywhere from Motown and James Brown to the music of Fats Waller and Thelonious Monk. In 2008, on her third appearance on Piano Jazz, Allen and McPartland perform a spontaneous composition. Allen solos on originals, including \\\"Brilliant Veracity.\\\"\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"As the U.S. war effort ramped up in the early 1940s, the Navy put out a request for chair design submissions. They needed a chair that was fireproof, waterproof, lightweight and strong enough to survive a torpedo blast. In response, engineer named Wilton C. Dinges designed a chair made out of aluminum, bent and welded to be super strong. To show off the durability of his creation, Dinges took it up to the eighth floor of a hotel in Chicago, where the Navy was examining submissions, and threw it out of the window. It bounced, but didn't bend or break. And so the Navy gave its inventor the contract, and he, in turn, opened a factory and called new his business the Electrical Machine and Equipment Company, or: Emeco. Over the decades the Emeco Navy chair became so popular that companies began to copy it. There are now tons of knockoffs \\u2014 fakes. Last month, Benjamen Walker of Theory of Everything walked 99% Invisible Host Roman Mars around New York city, pointing out real and fake Emeco chairs. 77 Steps\",\n",
